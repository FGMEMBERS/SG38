Special thanks goes to Patrice Poly for his amazing ASK13, which I use as a base for all of my glider models. Further a really huge thanks goes to Alexander Goernitz and the "Fliegerfreunde" Lenik and Maleschka for making it possible for me to get access to superior detailed constructional drawings of the SG38
